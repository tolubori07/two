<h1>The Past</h1>
<p>
   As a kid growing up in Lagos, Nigeria, my life from nursery through primary school was all about enjoying the vast amount of time I had. Whether through running a races with my neighbours(which would explain the athleticism I possess today), playing football with the neighbours or playing games while watching TV, every second was dedicated towards personal enjoyment. As I got into my first three years of secndary school, this trend continued despite a slight slump in my academic ability. I hadn't given much thought to my career choices and just assumed I would be a doctor. Coding was one of those things that I was too scared to even go to even though I really wanted to, It seemed like one of those things that was for the "smart people", it seemed difficult and I was limited by the fear of going out of my comfort zone. In lockdown however, my brother introduced me to web development and it didn't seem as difficult anymore. I got through HTML and CSS pretty quickly but i was still scared...of Javascript. I kept on coding as a hobby...
</p>
<p>All of a sudden, come December 2020 and I'm in a new country, a new world. I'm in England and my entire world is flipped on it's head... </p>

    <h1>The Present</h1>
    <p>Coming to England at first seemed like a bad thing to me, but now i realise that this move has helped me to start taking my career choices more seriously. I took on the challenge, buckled my belt, tied my shoe laces and grabbed the bull by it's horns. Integrating into the new system came to me easily(of course it took sometime to integrate socially). This sudden change also forced me to let go of whatever fear I had of Javascript and i also picked it up pretty quickly. Programming became my greatest hobby after playing basketball which i picked up after many years of playing football. I started to expose myself to more programming concepts and languages and got even more interested in programming.</p>
    <p>Fast forward two years ahead and I'm already 16 years old looking to get into web developer careers. I've finished my GCSE's and I'm sure that the results will be impressive because i've worked hard for it. I find Joy in consistently improving myself in all areas and through mentorship from my siblings and very very good parenting, I have people who give me good advice, feedback and guidance incase I start to slip. I've gotten some very good friends and I still play basketball every saturday with my brother elyas and some other friends.</p>
